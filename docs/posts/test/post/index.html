<p>#Summer with Splunk</p>
<p>This summer I received an unexpected opportunity to be a software engineer intern at Splunk’s Seattle office.</p>

<p>I applied fully on a whim. I mean really. I didn’t even bother writing a cover letter, it seemed impossibly out of reach for me. But somehow my resume alone was enough to continue the hiring process, and I did well enough in my interviews to get an offer. No complaints from me! :)</p>
<p>My first work task involved minor changes to the <a href="http://dev.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAECM">Splunk SDK for JavaScript</a>. This got me re-interested in Node.js, and prompted me to begin building <a href="https://github.com/shakeelmohamed/today-was">Today Was</a> in Node.</p>
<p>Then I transitioned into bringing <a href="http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/5.0.4/AdvancedDev/ModInputsIntro">modular input</a> support to the <a href="http://dev.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAAEBB">Splunk SDK for Python in version 1.1</a>. I really appreciated this task because it was a major feature that developers would use, and a chance for me to learn most of Python in about 3-4 weeks (crazy!).</p>
<p>But it hasn’t been all work. A few weeks ago the whole office went to a Mariner’s game for “intern day”, although I’m no longer a baseball fan I didn’t mind the view from a suite!</p>
<p>Since that time, I’ve been working on a demo using the new <a href="http://dev.splunk.com/view/app-framework/SP-CAAAEMA">Splunk App Framework Beta</a>.</p>
<p>A couple random things I’ve loved about my internship include getting to use a MacBook Pro and a standing desk.</p>
<p>Earlier this week my <a href="http://blogs.splunk.com/2013/09/10/the-splunk-sdk-for-python-gets-modular-input-support/">blog post</a> on my work on the Splunk SDK for Python went live, which has me re-interested in blogging. Next Friday would’ve been the last day of my internship, but my internship has been extended to part-time through the school year — PERFECT.</p>
